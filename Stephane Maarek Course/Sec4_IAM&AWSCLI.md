# Section 4: IAM & AWS CLI #

## IAM: Users & Groups ##

* IAM: Identity and Access Management, is a **Global** service
* Root account created by default, shouldn't be shared
* **Users** are people within the organisation, and can be _grouped_
* **Groups** only contain **users**, not other groups
* Users don't have to belong to a group, anyway they can be part of multiple groups

## IAM: Permissions ##
